Welcome to my collection from my Python Class. Includes notes and work taken while going through the course Python on Zero To Mastery!

In this course I am taking I will be going through begining with general knowledge and concepts of Python. Moving onto topics like web developement and AI/Machine Learning. With a wide range of uses I will be learning everything you can use python for. As I will be persuing my interest inside the cybersecerity space this is something important to learn as it is a good foundation to have with learning the code side of applications. I have some experience code already using javascript and React, although this langauge assists me more universally as Python is a language used widely outside of just Web Developement.

More to Come and be added as I progress! Thank you
